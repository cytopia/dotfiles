# .inputrc

This file edits the behavior of the terminal itself.
The inputrc file handles keyboard mapping for specific situations.
This file is the startup file used by Readline (the input-related library)
used by Bash and most other shells.

It makes it possible to enable vi-like or emacs-lile navigation in terminal.
